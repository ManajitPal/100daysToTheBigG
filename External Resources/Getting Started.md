    Here is the basic math you need to get started with competitive programming :
        * Number Theory - Sieve, primality test, fibonacci etc
        * Linear Algebra - Basic Matrices, multiplication, etc
        * Basic Algebra - Solving linear equations, finding unknown, etc
        * Statistics - Mean, Median, Variance, expected value
        * Basic Arithmetic concepts like mixtures, progressions, ratios, rational numbers, hcf / lcm etc.
        * Probability - Bayes' theorem, Probability distribution, etc
        * Co-ordinate Geometry - 2D, 3D space, distance between points, line equation, etc
        * Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics - Arrangements, sorting, permutations
        * Principles like Pigeon Hole, Inclusion-Exclusion, Induction etc 
    That is just for starting. Once you are comfortable with competitive programming you can learn following advance topics :
        * Graph Theory - Path, Node, Colouring, Matching, Components, Flow, etc
        * Calculus - Variable Minimisation, Maximisation
        * Error Analysis and Estimation. This is important for only few tricky probs
        * Game Theory - Nim Game, Grundy Number, etc.
        * Fast Fourier Tranformation
        * Modular Arithmetic
